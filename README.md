# Workday Scheduler

## Description

This allows you to input tasks that need to be completed from 9-5. The tasks will stay even if the browser is closed and reopened.

- I learned how to use the 'this' keyword for less coding.
- I was able to manipulate the local storage to save items.
- This allows a person to easily save tasks and delete them when they need.


## Installation

The scheduler can be accessed at: https://chasechambers.github.io/Workday-Scheduler/

## Usage

A user can key in their tasks in each hour block and then click save. When they refresh the page, the tasks will still be there. When they are done, they can just delete the task and click save again.

## Credits

I worked on this while looking up basic commands through day.js, W3Schools, and MDN.
AskBCS assisted with refactoring the code.
